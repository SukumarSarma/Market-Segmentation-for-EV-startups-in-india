Description:
Market Segmentation using ML and Data Analysis: “Electric Vehicle Start-up in India”.
- For geographic segmentation, we collect data on/identify urban areas with high
concentration of vehicle use/purchase, for psychographic we focus on data such as avg,
income of a region, etc. for demographic we use previous census data to segment the
individuals most likely to purchase vehicles.
- Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that the business should target Delhi, U.P, M.P
and Gujarat for setting up the market. The electric cars should be 5 seaters and the price
range should start from 1.5 lacs to attract buyers with age lying between 25-50 years old.
